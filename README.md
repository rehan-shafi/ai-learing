# AI Learning

This repository contains my personal learning journey in Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on:

- Machine Learning (ML)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Tools like Hugging Face, Transformers, LangChain, and more

I'll be organizing notes, small coding experiments, and key takeaways as I explore and grow in this field.
