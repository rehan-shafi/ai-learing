Definition: A subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows machines to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed.

Key Types:

Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data.

Unsupervised Learning: The model is trained on unlabeled data to identify patterns.

Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback.
