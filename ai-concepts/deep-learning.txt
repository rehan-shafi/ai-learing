Definition: A subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence the term "deep") to analyze various factors of data.

Key Concepts:

Neural Networks: A computational model inspired by the human brain.

Backpropagation: A method for training neural networks by adjusting weights based on error rates.

Activation Functions: Functions like sigmoid, ReLU that introduce non-linearity to the network.
