 Day Two Focus
 Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)
 Quick Review- Recap AI vs. ML vs. DL- Key terms: dataset, features, labels, training, testing, model, accuracy, etc.
 Types of Machine Learning
 1. Supervised Learning - with labeled data (e.g., spam detection)
 2. Unsupervised Learning - patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., customer segmentation)
 3. Reinforcement Learning - learning via rewards (e.g., robotics)
 How Models Learn- Training: models learn from data- Loss functions and optimization (gradient descent)- Concepts of overfitting and underfitting
 Optional Hands-On- Try no-code ML platforms:
  - Teachable Machine: teachablemachine.withgoogle.com
  - TensorFlow Playground: playground.tensorflow.org- Explore a beginner notebook on Kaggle
 Journal Prompt- What is ML in your own words?- Key takeaways about types of ML- Questions you still have
