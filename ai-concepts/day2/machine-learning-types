1. Supervised Learning 🧑‍🏫
Idea: The model learns from labeled data (input + correct output).

Think of it like a student learning with answer keys.

You show the model examples, and it learns to map input → output.

Examples:

Spam email detection (email → spam/not spam)

House price prediction (features → price)

Face recognition (image → person’s name)

Algorithms used:

Linear regression

Logistic regression

Decision trees

Random forest

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Neural networks (also used in deep learning)

2. Unsupervised Learning 🧩
Idea: The model works with unlabeled data and finds patterns or structures in it.

It explores the data to find hidden structures.

No correct answers are given — the model groups or organizes data by itself.

Examples:

Customer segmentation (grouping customers by behavior)

Topic modeling in documents

Anomaly detection (e.g., fraud detection)

Algorithms used:

K-Means Clustering

Hierarchical Clustering

PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

DBSCAN

3. Reinforcement Learning 🕹️
Idea: The model learns by interacting with an environment and getting rewards or penalties.

Like training a dog with treats and punishments.

It’s used when actions influence future states.

Examples:

Game-playing agents (like AlphaGo)

Robotics

Self-driving cars

Automated stock trading

Key Concepts:

Agent, Environment

Actions, States

Reward Signal

Policy (strategy the agent learns)

🧠 Bonus: Semi-Supervised & Self-Supervised Learning
Semi-Supervised: A mix of labeled and unlabeled data.

Self-Supervised: Model creates its own labels from raw data. (Used heavily in deep learning, including LLMs.)
